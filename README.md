## Description
This Coffee Machine simulation uses Python's OOP concepts to model a real-life coffee machine. It includes classes for managing different types of coffee, ingredients, and the machine's state, allowing users to interact as if they were at an actual coffee kiosk.

## How It Works
- Users can select from various coffee drinks.
- The machine checks if there are enough resources to make the selected drink.
- It processes payment, gives change, and dispenses the drink or refunds the money if conditions aren't met.
- Tracks inventory and can report the status of resources.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the source files.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the game files.
4. Run the simulation with:

```bash
python main.py
